# Smell Kiosk
Group Members: Andrew Lu, Xingbu Qin, Vivian Ross

**Purpose and Goals**

The goal of this project is to augment the sense of smell. To this end, we decided to create a digital ordering kiosk for a hypothetical smoothie shop. Just as current ordering kiosks allow a customer to order and pay for a meal, our smoothie kiosk would allow customers to select between different flavors of smoothies. However, in addition to just ordering a smoothie, our kiosk would allow a customer to smell the different available flavors in order to get an idea of what their smoothie might taste like. 

Our project also has a research component. We are curious as to how large an effect visual and olfactory cues have on a person's perception of taste. We are planning to test this using our smell delivery system and various flavors of water. Our hypothesis is that delivering a smell that does not match the flavoring of the water will confuse a user and cause them to perceive a taste that is different from the flavoring we provided. In addition, we are planning to use food coloring to test whether the visual appearance of a drink affects a user's perception of its flavor.
